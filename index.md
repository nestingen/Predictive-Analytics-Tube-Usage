## Predictive Analytics: Tube Usage
For this project, I wanted to do something dealing with manufacturing, since that is the field, I work in. I found my data from a Kaggle competition. Caterpillar had a competition about 5 years ago with the end goal of estimating the quoted price of tubing. Many tubes are in machines like forklifts, loaders, and bulldozers. Caterpillar provided tubing dimensions, annual usage, and past pricing for the contestants to build a predictive algorithm. My project will use this same data but instead of predicting price, I want to predict usage. I believe that there will be correlation between the many dimensions of the tubing and the annual usage.
